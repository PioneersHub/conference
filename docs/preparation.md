# Preparation

## Call for Committe Members

The call for people who help to prepare the conference and afterward.
This call is made 6-8 months before the conference.

Committees are listed in [/committees](committees/index.md).

- Review Committees and refine tasks
- Setup Tools for team to collaborate

## Call for Volunteers
The call for people who help during the conference. 
This call is usually done 6-8 weeks in before the conference.
It does not make sense to call for volunteers too early.
