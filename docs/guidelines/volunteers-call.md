## Volunteer Selection Process

Our conference is community-driven and strongly committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment. We believe
in the value of a diverse team and are particularly interested in ensuring that underrepresented minorities (URM) have a
voice and an active role in shaping our event. This philosophy extends to our volunteer selection process, where we aim
to build a team that reflects a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

### How We Select Volunteers:

The selection process for our volunteers is simple yet thoughtful, designed to ensure that our event is supported by
passionate individuals who are eager to contribute. Our process is structured around gathering key information about
each applicant to understand their background, motivations, and availability. Here’s how it works:

1. **Application Form**  
   We ask applicants to provide basic information such as their email address, full name, and country of residence. We
   also inquire about whether they’ve volunteered with us in the past to build on prior experience and foster long-term
   community engagement.

2. **Personal Background and Motivation**  
   In addition to collecting factual details, we also ask each applicant to tell us a bit about themselves and their
   background. This helps us understand the unique perspectives they bring to the conference. We encourage applicants to
   share what motivates them to volunteer and how they’d like to contribute. This information is crucial as it helps us
   gauge not only their enthusiasm but also how they envision supporting the event.

3. **Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion**  
   Our community places a high value on diversity and inclusion. In line with this, we are particularly keen to hear
   from individuals from underrepresented groups and those who can offer different perspectives. While we do not require
   extensive experience, we prioritize applicants who share our commitment to creating a welcoming and supportive
   environment for all participants.

4. **Meeting Availability**  
   One day before the conference, we organize an in-person meeting with all volunteers at the venue. This meeting is
   essential for familiarizing volunteers with the layout of the venue, reviewing tasks, and building team cohesion. We
   ask volunteers to confirm their availability for this meeting to ensure that they can fully engage in the preparation
   process.

5. **Selection Criteria**
    - **Passion and Motivation**: We prioritize individuals who demonstrate a genuine interest in contributing to the
      success of the event and supporting the community.
    - **Diversity and Representation**: We actively seek to build a volunteer team that reflects diverse backgrounds,
      including gender, ethnicity, and geographic diversity.
    - **Availability and Commitment**: Volunteers must be available to support the event for a total of 9 hours,
      including attending the pre-conference meeting.

6. **Final Selection and Notification**  
   Once we review all applications, we will select a diverse group of volunteers based on their background, motivation,
   and availability. Selected volunteers will be notified via email, and detailed information about their roles and
   tasks will be provided.
