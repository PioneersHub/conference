# General Considerations

We want to give the following instructions about the CfP with information what the event is looking for.

Content related things we want to consider:
 - topics of interest
 - submission types (30-minute talks, 3-hour workshop, etc.)
 - levels of expertise (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

Non-content related things we want to consider:
 - perks for accepted speakers (free ticket, travel reimbursement, etc.)
 - perks not to expected (no travel reimbursement, etc.) - _other conferences might offer this_
 - mentoring offers for first-time speakers
 - diversity and inclusion efforts (grants, etc.)
 - inclusion (e.g., childcare, accessibility)

## Policies

We discussed policies in the team before launching the CfP.
It's useful to have consistent policies settled beforehand and communicate them clearly to the submitters.

We accept accept presentations that:

- can only be delivered remotely?
- have been given elsewhere already?
- are available on video already?
- are part of a sales pitch?
- cannot be published on video afterward?

Consider setting a policy and being explict about:

- percentage of slots for beginner, intermediate, and advanced talks
- percentage of slots for first-time speakers
- accepting one presentation per speaker only

### About the Conference

Our conference offers dedicated tracks for various interests, with both on-site and remote access for attendees. While
attendees can choose how they participate, presenters are required to deliver their sessions in person at the venue.

To submit your proposal, scroll down to the **Submit a proposal** button. Feel free to forward this call to anyone you
think might be interested in contributing.

Our event brings together developers, data scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts from different fields to discuss a
wide range of topics. Talks cover various technical advancements, community development, and insights from practical
applications. The sessions are designed to cater to a broad audience, from beginners to experts, with a focus on sharing
knowledge, tools, and experiences.

## Conference Tracks & Topics of Interest

The conference will feature multiple tracks with around **100 talks** in total. You can submit your proposal under the
following tracks:

- **Technology & Software Development**
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**
- **Community, Diversity & Inclusion**
- **Ethics, Privacy, and Career**
- **Infrastructure & Cloud**
- **Industry & Academia Use Cases**
- **Others (for topics that don't fit into the above categories)**

We encourage presentations on a variety of topics related to programming, software engineering, data science, machine
learning, and more. Our aim is to provide a diverse range of content that includes both technical and community-related
topics.

## Presentation Format

Presentations can be at: **novice, intermediate, or advanced levels**. Talks will have two possible lengths: either **30
or 45
minutes**. Hands-on **tutorials** will be **90 minutes** long. While attendees can join remotely, all presenters are
required to
deliver their sessions in person.

Accepted presentations will receive **one free conference ticket**. Additional speakers must purchase a ticket. While we
cannot cover travel expenses, we do offer a
diversity travel program and encourage speakers from diverse backgrounds to apply for funding.

## Submission Process

To submit your proposal, use the **Submit a proposal** button below. The conference committee will review all proposals
and provide feedback if needed. We especially encourage first-time speakers and will work with you to improve your
submission if necessary.

## Your Submission

Attendees typically pay close attention to the abstracts when deciding which talks to attend. Therefore, we recommend
writing a clear and concise abstract that reflects the value of your talk. Your abstract will be published in the
conference program as-is, though you may update it later.

Please ensure that your content is original and has not been presented at other conferences. We aim to offer our
attendees fresh and engaging ideas. Include key details such as:

- The problem your talk addresses.
- Why the problem is relevant to the audience.
- Your proposed solution.
- The main takeaways from your talk (for tutorials, clearly state what attendees will learn).

## Diversity & First-Time Speakers

We strongly encourage **first-time speakers and submissions from underrepresented groups** in the community. We are
committed to supporting diversity and inclusion at our event and aim to offer mentorship opportunities for first-time
speakers. Please stay tuned for updates.

## Diversity Travel Sponsorship

As a non-profit, volunteer-run conference, we have limited travel funding available through our diversity program. If
you are interested in applying for travel support, visit our Diversity Program page. For companies interested in
supporting diversity initiatives, there are **several sponsorship opportunities** available. Please reach out to us for
more details.

## Open Source

Our event is committed to the **open-source community**. We encourage presenters to share the code and tools discussed
in their talks. Ideally, the audience should have access to the necessary resources to reproduce your results. We also
encourage talks that focus on practical applications of tools and discourage product-focused sales pitches.

We ask all participants to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://example.com/code-of-conduct), ensuring a welcoming and
inclusive environment for everyone.
