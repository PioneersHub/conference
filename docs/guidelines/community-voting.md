# Community Voting

!!! warn "This document is a work in progress"
    This document is a work in progress and is subject to change.

The community voting for {{config.extra.event.event_name}} is now open. It's important for us to understand what the
community is most excited to see at the conference. Voting will run for two weeks from:

> **{{config.extra.event.voting_start}}**  
> until  
> **{{config.extra.event.voting_end}}**

### Guiding Principles

- Open to the community
- Gives the community a voice in shaping the conference program
- Unbiased: speakers' names are not displayed on the voting page
- Submissions are shown in a random order for each participant
- Fraud-resistant: no new identities can be set up for voting purposes
- Helps reduce the burden on organizers who volunteer their time
- Simple participation without the need to create new online accounts

### Who Can Participate?

To participate in the voting process, you need an email address that is recognized by the system, meaning it was used
for one of the following:

- Participation in any of our past conferences
- Submission of a talk for a previous or the current conference
- Volunteering for the current conference

### How to Access the Voting Page

- Go to [the community voting page]({{config.extra.event.voting_url}}).
- Enter a qualified email address (see: "Who Can Participate" above)
- The system will verify if the email address is in the database. If it is, you will receive an email with a magic link.
- Check your inbox (and spam) for the email containing the magic link.

#### What if You Don't Remember the Email Address?

- Try any email addresses that may be linked to your participation in previous conferences—the site will give immediate
  feedback if the address is recognized.
- If you no longer have access to a previously used email (e.g., a work email from a former employer), unfortunately, we
  cannot add or change email addresses manually.

You should stay logged in automatically, but if you're logged out, you can always use the link from the email again or
request a new magic link by re-entering your email address.

Please note, emails are sent instantly but might take a few minutes to arrive due to potential delays from your mail
provider.

### How Does the Voting System Work?

- Voting helps us understand the topics the community is most interested in.
- The voting system only allows positive votes; there’s no option to downvote proposals.
- Your votes are saved as you go, and you can change them anytime until voting ends.
- Votes are automatically saved upon selection.

You can vote using the following options:

- **Must see**
- **Would like to see**
- **Not interested / Indifferent**

This will help us gauge the preferences of the community.

**Disclaimer:** Proposals are published as submitted by the authors. The program committee has not edited them.
Please ignore any typos or formatting issues.

If you find a proposal that is **offensive** or **violates** our [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct/index.md),
please report it to us at: [{{config.extra.event.contact_program}}].

### Selection of Submissions

Community voting plays a significant role in the selection process. However, the final selection is made by the program
committee. We strive to create a diverse and well-rounded conference program that balances popular topics with niche or
new ideas that reflect our community’s diversity.
