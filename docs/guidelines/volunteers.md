### Registration Desk ==(Starting on *day before the conference* at 15:00)==

Location: ==ADD==

Your responsibilities at the Registration Desk include welcoming conference attendees, validating their ticket, and
providing them with badges, wristbands and relevant conference information.   
(Please note: Student ticket holders must present a valid student-ID along with their ticket).  

Swags: Attendees who have signed up for a conference T-shirt will receive it at a designated time during the first day.
To claim their T-shirt, attendees must present their badge with the corresponding size indicated and will receive a
badge punch to ensure they do not receive multiple T-shirts.

### Rooms: Speakers Set Up & Room Regulations

We require a minimum of **2 volunteers per room**: one to assist the video committee in setting up speakers before each
talk, and another to enforce room regulations.

Room regulations mandate that **all attendees be seated, with no standing individuals permitted**, and that **rooms do
not exceed maximum seating capacity**.  
Volunteers should ensure compliance with these regulations and, if necessary, facilitate the Q\&A session by passing the
microphone to attendees.

For the main room we need 4-5 volunteers stationed at each entrance There are ==6 entrances==, so volunteers
assigned to this room should convene before their shift to divide and cover all entrances effectively.

For tutorial rooms, volunteers must verify that only attendees who have signed up for tutorials are granted entry (
verified by their corresponding wristbands). Room regulations also apply to tutorial rooms.

### Tutorials Sign Up (@Registration Desk)

A dedicated space at the Registration Desk allows attendees to sign up for tutorials. Upon registration, attendees will
receive a badge punch and a dedicated wristband, which must be presented before entering the tutorial room. Please note
that tutorial attendance is on a first-come, first-served basis, with a maximum number of wristbands available per
tutorial.

### Setting up / Cleaning up

This task involves assisting with the preparation of attendee badges the day before the conference, setting up
registration on the first morning, distributing signs, and other related duties.   
At the end of the last conference day, volunteers will assist in restoring the venue to its original state and ensuring
cleanliness.

### Runners

Throughout the conference, volunteers may be needed to provide various forms of assistance, such as moving equipment,
delivering messages, managing room capacities, and supporting fellow volunteers.   
Please remain on standby at the central meeting point (Registration Desk) for further instructions, or return there if
you complete your task ahead of schedule.

**Runners for session chairs:** Before each talk, we require 2 volunteers to confirm the presence of the session chairs
in each room (you will receive a list with their names).   
Once this task is completed, please return to the central meeting point and await further instructions.
