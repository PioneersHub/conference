# :fontawesome-solid-book-atlas: Volunteer-Driven Conference Playbook

This playbook helps to organize a conference with a team of volunteers.

It is based on the experience of running and co-organizing events like [PyCon DE](https://de.pycon.org/),
[EuroPython](https://europython.eu), [EuroSciPy](https://euroscipy.org) and [PyData Berlin](https://berlin.pydata.org).

## Why write a playbook?

Volunteer-driven conferences are a great way to bring people together and share knowledge.

They are also a lot of work and require a lot of coordination.

This playbook is supposed to give a starting point and provide a structure for organizing a conference.

## Table of Contents

1. Preparations
2. Mission statement
3. Committees
4. Call for Volunteers
5. Guidelines
6. Office
7. Zen for Conference Organizers
