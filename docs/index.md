# Volunteer-Driven Conference Playbook

This playbook helps to organize a conference with a team of volunteers.

It is based on the experience of running and co-organizing events like EuroPython, PyConDE, PyData or EuroSciPy.

## Why write a playbook?

Volunteer-driven conferences are a great way to bring people together and share knowledge.
They are also a lot of work and require a lot of coordination.
This playbook is supposed to give a starting point and provide a structure for organizing a conference.

## Table of Contents

1. Preparations
2. Operational Model
3. Call for Volunteers
4. Milestones
5. Communication
