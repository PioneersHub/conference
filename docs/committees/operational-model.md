!!! tip "Pycon DE & PyData 2025 works 'Distributed & Asynchronous'"
    We are a large team and we have made excellent experience in the past working this way.

# Operational Models

There are multiple operational models to consider:

For a **smaller conference** and team **"all-hands-on-deck"** meetings might be sufficient.

On the other hand, for larger teams, "all-hand-on-deck" meetings might be too time-consuming and not efficient.
Where is the point in attending a meeting if you have only 5 minutes of input?
Larger meetings are also harder to schedule.
We have to be considerate of the time of our volunteers and make sure that we are not wasting it.

For larger teams, it's more efficient and enjoyable to have **distributed and asynchronous** meetings.

## Distributed & Asynchronous

This playbook works well for larger teams.

## All Hands on Deck

This playbook works well for smaller teams as well, though some people will likely have multiple roles.
