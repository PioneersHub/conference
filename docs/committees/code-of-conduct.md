# Code of Conduct Committee

## Mission

The Code of Conduct (CoC) Committee task is to ensure the enforcement of, adherence to, and education about the
organization's code of conduct. This committee does not have chairs; it's a representative group of people that can
reason about incidents from multiple perspectives and is approachable by community members.

The CoC Committee is also responsible for handling reports within the organization committees.

## Committee Structure

### Members

A team of four committee members from diverse backgrounds and experiences.

## Requirements

* Previous experience with CoC is expected or the willingness to take part in a professional training (4 hours,
  remotely) which the organization will provide
* Not participate in other committees for neutrality
* Be in attendance on-site at {{config.extra.event.event_name}}

## Responsibilities

- **Familiarize yourself with the Code of Conduct**  
  Familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct/index.md),
  the [Code of Conduct Enforcement Procedures](../code-of-conduct/enforcement-procedures.md) and
  the [Procedure For Incident Response](../code-of-conduct/reporting.md).

- **Monitor and Respond:**  
  We actively monitor the event to ensure the Code of Conduct is upheld. If any issues arise, we respond quickly and
  appropriately, taking necessary actions to resolve conflicts.

- **Support Attendees:**  
  Our committee serves as a point of contact for anyone who feels unsafe or experiences inappropriate behavior. We
  provide guidance and support while addressing concerns in a confidential manner.

- **Collaborate with Other Committees:**  
  We work closely with the **Diversity Committee** and the **Program Committee** to ensure that our conference remains
  accessible, inclusive, and diverse. Together, we ensure that speakers and participants reflect the richness of our
  community.

- **Review Reports:**  
  When a breach of the Code of Conduct is reported, our committee carefully reviews the situation, gathers all necessary
  information, and makes informed decisions about how to address the issue.

- **Be Visible and Present:**  
  Ensure the Code of Conduct Committee is visible and accessible throughout the conference. Attend the opening session to introduce the committee and its role, and be present during the event to address any issues that arise.

- **Reporting:**  
  Provide an update on Code of Conduct matters during the closing session and prepare a post-conference report for publication on the website.

### Workload

The workload for the Code of Conduct Committee depends on the size of the event and the number of reports or incidents
that may arise. During the conference, the team must be ready to respond quickly to any concerns. However, proactive
efforts like pre-conference training, monitoring event spaces, and ensuring the CoC is visible and understood also
contribute to the overall workload. The intensity can vary, but the committeeâ€™s readiness to ensure a safe, inclusive
environment is always a top priority.
