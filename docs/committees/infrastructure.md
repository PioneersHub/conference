### Workload

The workload for the Infrastructure Committee is flexible and largely depends on the specific tasks and goals at hand.
Early stages of planning may involve setting up or refining the website, automating processes, and coordinating with
other committees to understand their needs.

Work typically fluctuates based on deadlines, with moderate activity in the early months and more intense work closer to
the conference as final systems need to be in place. The workload also spikes when troubleshooting technical issues or
implementing last-minute changes, especially during the conference itself.

While much of the work can be done in advance, ongoing monitoring and maintenance will be required to ensure systems run
smoothly. Overall, the workload is manageable and can be distributed across the team, with peaks depending on specific
tasks or urgent issues that may arise.

* Preparations: a few hours per week
* Conference: depending on preparation beforehand more or less workload.
