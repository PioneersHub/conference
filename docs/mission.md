## Common Mission Goals for Volunteers

### 1. We Provide Valuable Content

We support the delivery of high-quality talks and presentations from knowledgeable speakers. This includes creating
opportunities for networking, organizing workshops, and ensuring the public release of conference talks.

We strive to build a well-organized and supportive network for all participants—whether they’re beginners, newcomers, or
seasoned experts—while remaining accessible, inclusive, and helpful throughout the event.

### 3. We Foster a Welcoming Environment

We ensure the conference is an inclusive, safe space where attendees from all backgrounds and experience levels can
share knowledge and connect with others. We are committed to promoting diversity, inclusion, and accessibility in every
aspect of the event.

### 4. We Maintain High Standards

We uphold the conference’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility, and we ensure respectful conduct at

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

You’ll have the opportunity to build on the strong foundation laid by previous conferences. Many tasks and processes
from past events can be reused or adapted to fit our current needs, allowing us to focus on continuous improvement
rather than reinventing the wheel. Our goal is to make each conference better than the last.

Remember, the tasks outlined are meant to be tackled as a team. Don’t worry if you can’t take on every
responsibility—each person will contribute in their own way to help make this a successful event!

## Mentoring and Support

Chairs and committee members from previous conferences will be available to onboard and support you. They will serve as
mentors and sparring partners, sharing their experience and expertise to guide you along the way.
