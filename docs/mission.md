# ðŸš€ Join Our Community-Driven Conference!

## What's a Community-Driven Conference?

Imagine a conference where everyone, from attendees to speakers to organizers, comes together to create something
amazing. That's us! We're not a big corporation â€“ we're a group of passionate volunteers who believe in the power of
sharing knowledge and building connections.

## Our Mission: What We're All About

### 1. We Share Awesome Content

We bring you talks, workshops, and presentations from brilliant minds in our field. But it's not just about listening â€“
it's about connecting, learning, and growing together.

### 2. We're Here for You

Whether you're a coding newbie or a tech veteran, we've got your back. Our goal is to create an event where everyone
feels welcome and supported.

### 3. We Create a Welcoming Space

Diversity isn't just a buzzword for us â€“ it's our strength. We're committed to making our conference a safe, inclusive
space where everyone can thrive.

### 4. We Aim for Excellence

We hold ourselves to high standards in everything we do, from organizing the event to ensuring respectful behavior from
all participants.

## Who We're Looking For

We need enthusiastic volunteers like you! You don't need to be an expert â€“ just bring your:

- Excitement about creating an awesome experience for everyone
- Willingness to lend a hand wherever it's needed
- Passion for including people from all walks of life
- Team spirit and openness to new ideas and people
- Eagerness to learn and grow while helping others do the same

## Building on Success

We're not starting from scratch â€“ we're standing on the shoulders of giants! We learn from past conferences and
constantly improve. As a volunteer, you'll be part of this evolution.

## You Won't Be Alone

Worried about not knowing what to do? Don't be! Experienced organizers will be there to guide you every step of the way.
We're all in this together!

## Our Guiding Principles

We follow a set of principles we call "Zen for Community Organizers." It helps us stay focused on what really
matters. [Check it out here](zen.md)
