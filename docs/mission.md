## What's a Community-Driven Conference?

Imagine a conference where everyone, from attendees to speakers to organizers, comes together to create something amazing. That's us! We're not a big corporation â€“ we're a group of passionate volunteers who believe in the power of sharing knowledge and building connections.

## Our Mission: What We're All About

### 1. We Share Awesome Content
We bring you talks, workshops, and presentations from brilliant minds in our field. But it's not just about listening â€“ it's about connecting, learning, and growing together.

### 2. We're Here for You
Whether you're a coding newbie or a tech veteran, we've got your back. Our goal is to create an event where everyone feels welcome and supported.

### 3. We Create a Welcoming Space
Diversity isn't just a buzzword for us â€“ it's our strength. We're committed to making our conference a safe, inclusive space where everyone can thrive.

### 4. We Aim for Excellence
We hold ourselves to high standards in everything we do, from organizing the event to ensuring respectful behavior from all participants.

## Who We're Looking For

We need enthusiastic volunteers like you! You don't need to be an expert â€“ just bring your:

- Excitement about creating an awesome experience for everyone
- Willingness to lend a hand wherever it's needed
- Passion for including people from all walks of life
- Team spirit and openness to new ideas and people
- Eagerness to learn and grow while helping others do the same

## Building on Success

We're not starting from scratch â€“ we're standing on the shoulders of giants! We learn from past conferences and constantly improve. As a volunteer, you'll be part of this evolution.

## You Won't Be Alone

Worried about not knowing what to do? Don't be! Experienced organizers will be there to guide you every step of the way. We're all in this together!

## Our Guiding Principles

We follow a set of principles we call "Zen for Community Organizers." It helps us stay focused on what really matters. [Check it out here](zen.md)

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to build on the strong foundation laid by previous conferences. Many tasks and processes
from past events can be reused or adapted to fit our current needs, allowing us to focus on continuous improvement
rather than reinventing the wheel. Our goal is to make each conference better than the last.

Remember, the tasks outlined are meant to be tackled as a team. Donâ€™t worry if you canâ€™t take on every
responsibilityâ€”each person will contribute in their own way to help make this a successful event!

## Mentoring and Support

Chairs and committee members from previous conferences will be available to onboard and support you. They will serve as
mentors and sparring partners, sharing their experience and expertise to guide you along the way.
