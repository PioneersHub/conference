Perfectionism is the enemy of the good.  
Do good.

Responsibilities are like weights;   
lift them and grow strong.

The power of creation lies in the meaning it brings.  
Give your peers to room create.

Consensus breeds comfort;   
majority calls bring clarity.  
Multiple paths lead to success.

Trust is the foundation of collaboration.  
Unity in purpose drives collective achievement.  

Diversity in ideas enriches the outcome.  

Celebrate small victories,   
for they lead to bigger wins.

Passion is contagious;   
spread it generously.

You might wrap your head around everything,  
but trained experts excel with experience.

Be modest about your inexperience,   
yet bold in your attempts.

Balance structure with spontaneity for the best results.  

Delegate wisely,   
for teamwork makes the dream work.

Feedback is a gift;   
accept it with grace.
