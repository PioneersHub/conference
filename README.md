## How To Use

## How to Use

On the [GitHub page of this repository](https://github.com/PioneersHub/conference),
click on the "Use this template" button at the upper right side.

Select where you want to create the repository and give it a custom name.
Best practice is to use an **all-lowercase** name with **hyphens** instead of spaces.
Anything else will be tricky as GitHub pages in some parts is case-sensitive.
